    "The BV altorithm can take advantage of superposition and entanglement to encdoe the problem and produce an ansswer with a single oracle (black box function) query. The setup is a register of n qubits in the $|0\\rangle$ state and a single auxiliary qubit in the #|1\\rangle$ state. The auxiliary qubit enables the phase kickback. Consider the register of $n$ qubits initialized here:  \n",

    "$$ U_f \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^n}} \\sum_x^{n-1}|x\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^n}} \\sum_x^{n-1} (-1)^{f(x)} |x\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^n}} \\sum_x^{n-1} (-1)^{a*x}|x\\rangle $$\n",
    "Applying Hadamard gates again returns the following state:\n",
    "$$ H \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^n}} \\sum_x^{n-1} (-1)^{a*x}|x\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^n}} \\sum^{n-1}_{x,y} (-1)^{a*x} (-1)^{y*x} |y\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^n}} \\sum^{n-1}_y \\sum^{n-1}_x (-1)^{(a\\oplus y)*x} |y\\rangle$$\n",
    "In the case of a != y, the entire term becomes zero, In the case offa= y, the state $|a\\rangle$ is returned with an amplitude of 1. This means there is a 100% changce of the measurement resulting being the hidden bitstring $a$ with only one call to the oracle!\n"
